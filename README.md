In this project, we explore five convex hull algorithms and three line intersection algorithms, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of these fundamental computational geometry concepts. The convex hull algorithms under scrutiny include the Graham's Scan, Jarvis March, QuickHull, Brute Force Algorithm, and Monotone. Each algorithm will be analyzed for its efficiency, strengths, and potential use cases in different scenarios.

Simultaneously, we delve into three line intersection algorithms, namely the Clockwise Algorithm, Area of Triangle Algorithm, and the Slope Intercept Algorithm. By examining these algorithms, we aim to uncover their intricacies, advantages, and limitations in solving the line intersection problem. The project will involve implementing and testing each algorithm, comparing their runtime complexities, and assessing their suitability for various applications, such as computer graphics, geographic information systems, and robotics.
