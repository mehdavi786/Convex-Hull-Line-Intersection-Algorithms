# Convex-Hull-Line-Intersection-Algorithms
In this project, we explore five convex hull algorithms and three line intersection algorithms, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of these fundamental computational geometry concepts. Each algorithm will be analyzed for its efficiency, strengths, and potential use cases in different scenarios.
